# Demo Scaffold

https://project-scaffold.netlify.app/

A simple set of components and basic typography to help jump start demo sites and proofs of concepts. This project uses 11ty and WebC in order to structure its components as singe file components and be as re-usable and portable to other frameworks as possible.
